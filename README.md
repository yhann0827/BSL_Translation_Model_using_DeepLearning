</br></br>
This project aims to develop a British Sign Language (BSL) recognition model that can accurately translate sign language into text in real-time, thereby facilitating the accessibility and communication for individuals who use sign language as their primary means of communication. 

## Overview
The British Sign Language Recognition System employs three recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to recognize British Sign Language (BSL) gestures in real-time. TensorFlow and Keras libraries are utilized for training and prediction. Users can select the model for testing by uncommenting it in the code cell and perform comparisons. Our results indicate that the GRU model outperforms the SimpleRNN and LSTM models in terms of accuracy and effectiveness for sign language recognition.
